## Welcome to ajaymin28's OpenSource GitHub.

I'm a Computer Engineer, on my way to research Computer Vision and Deep Learning to help Humanity.

### [Adavanced Computer Vision using OpenCV Python](https://github.com/ajaymin28/Advanced-Computer-Vision-using-OpenCV-Python)

Advanced Computer Vision using OpenCV Python is a course designed by me, to share my 2+ years experience with OpenCV Python, Deep Learning and Machine Learning.

You can find video tutorials here : 
1. [Introduction opencv python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwRoxHWReaEhVFjTeKlifKUimbw6ZyV7K)
2. [Basic Image Processing using OpenCV Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwRoxHWReaEiW7Jre38mlmzCZr2GPetIs)

### [Aruco Python](https://github.com/ajaymin28/Aruco_python)

Aruco Python is binding for Aruco C++ library available in OpenCV.

### [Face Features](https://face-features.herokuapp.com/)

Face features is my current ongoing project which aims on taking out facial features, which consist of dtecting faces, emotions, drowsiness, drunk faces etc.
