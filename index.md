## Welcome to ajaymin28's OpenSource GitHub.

I'm a Computer Engineer, on my way to research Computer Vision and Deep Learning to help Humanity.

### 1. [Edge Device Computing, When to use GPU/TPU/DSP?](https://cvforeveryone28.blogspot.com/2021/01/the-era-of-edge-computing-utilizing.html)

This blog talks about when to utilize which device, based on your model and suported ops of your device. How to visualize your deep learning model? And a bit of advise/tips from my experice.

### 2. [Adavanced Computer Vision using OpenCV Python](https://github.com/ajaymin28/Advanced-Computer-Vision-using-OpenCV-Python)

Advanced Computer Vision using OpenCV Python is a course designed by me, to share my 2+ years experience with OpenCV Python, Deep Learning and Machine Learning.
