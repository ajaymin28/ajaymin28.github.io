## Welcome to ajaymin28's OpenSource GitHub.

I'm a Computer Engineer, on my way to research Computer Vision and Deep Learning to help Humanity.

### [Aruco Python](https://github.com/ajaymin28/Aruco_python)

Aruco Python is biding for Aruco C++ library available in OpenCV, there are no such clear documents available to code aruco in python so made it avaialable for people.
